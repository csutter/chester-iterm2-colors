> [!NOTE]
> I've not used iTerm2 in many years, and have not had time to update this project either, so I have decided to officially archive it - consider forking if you are interested in continuing development.

A colour scheme for the [iTerm2 terminal emulator](http://iterm2.com/) using pretty colours from Lonely Planet's [Rizzo styles](https://github.com/lonelyplanet/rizzo).

There is also a corresponding syntax highlighting theme for the Atom text editor: [csutter/chester-atom-syntax](https://github.com/csutter/chester-atom-syntax).
